Blackjack JS game!

I've build this Blackjack game app using a bit of HTML and CSS and primarily Javascript as a part of the Frontend developer career path at Scrimba

Along the way I learnt such concepts as:

arrays,
objects,
booleans,
if else statements,
comparison operators,
logical operators,
for loops,
the Math object(Math.floor(), Math.round()),
return statements
